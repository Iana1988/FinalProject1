          <h2>Discover Modern Bangkok</h2>
		  <p>After exploring the rich traditions of Thailand, it's time to see a different side of the capital 
		     — the modern face of Bangkok, where nature, culture, and skyscrapers come together in one exciting city.</p>
		  <p><strong>Lumphini Park.</strong>&nbsp; Right in the center of the bustling city, Lumphini Park offers a peaceful escape from the noise.
		     It's a perfect place to relax, take a walk, or watch locals practicing tai chi in the morning light. The
		     calm lake, shady trees, and open spaces create a refreshing break from urban life. Visitors are
		     often amazed to spot giant monitor lizards strolling near the water — a surprising and
		     unforgettable part of the park's charm.</p>
		  <p><strong>Baiyoke Sky Tower.</strong>&nbsp; One of the tallest and most iconic buildings in Bangkok, the Baiyoke Sky
		     Tower offers breathtaking views of the city. From its observation deck, you can see far and wide - modern skyscrapers,
		     colorful streets, and even the Chao Phraya River winding in the distance. Whether during 
		     the day or at night, the view is spectacular and shows just how big, bright, and modern Bangkok truly is.</p>
