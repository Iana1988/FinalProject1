          <h2>About Me</h2>
		  <p> My name is Iana, and I love to travel and explore new cultures. My family and I spent a long time
		      preparing for our trip to Thailand, and even though the flight was long, it was absolutely worth 
			  it. We were amazed by the beauty of the landscapes, the rich traditions, and the peaceful spirit we
			  found everywhere. Thailand truly surprised us with its warm people, delicious food, and
			  unforgettable experiences.</p>
